rainfall_mi is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every 
month separated by a comma. Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. 
Store the result in the variable num_rainy_months. In other words, count the number of items with values > 3.0.

Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.

rainfall_mi = "1.65, 1.46, 2.05, 3.03, 3.35, 3.46, 2.83, 3.23, 3.5, 2.52, 2.8, 1.85"
a=rainfall_mi.split(',')
count=0
for i in a:
    if(float(i)>3.0):
        count+=1
        
num_rainy_months=count
print(num_rainy_months)
