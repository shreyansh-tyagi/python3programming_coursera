seqmut-1-9: Which of these is the accumulator variable?

byzo = 'hello world!'
c = 0
for x in byzo:
    z = x + "!"
    print(z)
    c = c + 1
A. byzo
B. x
C. z
D. c

✔️ Yes, this is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have a full count of how many items are in byzo.

seqmut-1-11: Which of these is the iterator (loop) variable?

lst = [5, 10, 3, 8, 94, 2, 4, 9]
num = 0
for item in lst:
    num += item
